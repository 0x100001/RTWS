# RTWS
 A simple tool that you can use to check if a service exists and it's status on a remote computer.
# Condition
 It will sort them as follows:\
 -Service found and running.\
 -Service exists but is not running.\
 -Service does not exist.\
 -Calculator not available.

# Add machines to be checked
 You can add a hostname manually, import a list from txt or use Active Directory.

# Miscellaneous
 You can also export the computer list in a Powershell-enabled format.

# How to use
 Add computers to the computer panel.\
 Specify the service you want to check.\
 Start and wait for the application to respond.\
 It may take a while for the process to be completed - the interface is not operable during this time.\
 \
 If you got any questions, feel free to open a issue.
